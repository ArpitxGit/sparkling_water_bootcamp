# Week1

## Day1

We learned about basics of cryptography,  
Hard math problems, why we need hard maths problems,  
Why we need a good math library, effecient signature schemes and algorithms,  
Why we need to keep implementing and be a performer,

We'll follow a similar path like this in sparkling water bootcamp:

- Finitie Fields
- Elliptic Curves
- Polynomials
- Signatures
- Key Exchange mechanism
- ZKP Schemes
- Groth
- Plonk
- Stark based protocols

We also got to know about, Fast multiplicative inverse without leaking secret data and Side channel attacks

## Day2

We got to know about,  
In starks, there are trace values, which isnâ€™t fast,  
Extensions are useful while working with EC and pairings

## Day3

Explanation of RSA, Field organization, and more on basics operations

## Day4

We touched upon,
Carmichael totient function,
Example where we use negative coefficient : Ntru,

## Day5

We went very little through,  
Field Extensions, EC Pairing, KZG based SNARKs,  
In STARKs we work with smaller fields  
Also, Pairing for Beginners(Book) is a good resource.
