# Polynomials

A polynomial is a mathematical expression involving a sum of powers of a variable, typically denoted by x, each multiplied by a coefficient.
These coefficients are elements from a specified set, such as real numbers, complex numbers, or elements of a field.

The general form of a polynomial in one variable x is:
p(x)= a(n)x^n+a(n−1)x^(n−1)+…+a(2)x^(2)+a(1)x+a0
where: n is a non-negative integer called the degree of the polynomial (provided ≠ 0 a n=0).,−1,…,1,0 a n ,a n−1,…,a 1,a 0 are the coefficients of the polynomial, which belong to a specified set or field, x is the variable or indeterminate.
The degree of the polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial with a non-zero coefficient. If all coefficients are zero, the polynomial is typically considered to have no degree or sometimes said to have a degree of negative infinity.

Polynomials can be used to model various real-world situations, such as trajectories in physics, and are fundamental in areas of mathematics like algebra and calculus. They also form a basis for polynomial functions, where the polynomial expression is used to define a function mapping values of x to values of p(x).
