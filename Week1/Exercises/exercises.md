# What is a group, a subgroup, a ring, a field and generators

### Group

A set of elements combined with an operation that satisfies four key properties:  
_Closure, Associativity, Identity, and Inverse_

Think of a group as a group of people on a planet.  
The operation is like people exchanging gifts with each other.  
To form a group, everyone should exchange gifts with everyone else in the group at least once.

- Closure: If Alice gives Bob a gift, and Bob gives Carol a gift, then Alice should also be able to give Carol a gift. The group is closed under gift-giving.
- Associativity: The order in which gifts are exchanged does not matter; it's an associative operation.
- Identity: There's one person in the group who never receives or gives gifts. This person is the "identity" because giving or receiving a gift from them doesn't change anything.
- Inverse: For every person who gives a gift, there's someone who receives it, and vice versa. So, if Alice gives a gift to Bob, Bob must also give a gift to Alice.

### Subgroup

A subset of a group that itself forms a group, satisfying the same four properties.  
Imagine within the planet's population, there's a subgroup of friends who only exchange gifts among themselves.  
This subgroup follows the same gift-giving rules as the larger group, and it's still a group.

### Ring

A set with two operations, typically addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties.  
It includes _Closure, Associativity, Identity for addition, and Distributivity._

Consider a planetary system with multiple planets.  
The addition operation could represent adding the number of moons on two planets, and the multiplication operation could represent multiplying the distances between two planets.

- Closure: When you add or multiply the properties of any two planets, the result is still a property of the planets (e.g., adding the number of moons or distances between planets).
- Associativity: The order in which you perform these operations doesn't affect the final result.
- Identity for Addition: There's a planet with zero moons (identity for addition) and a planet at a unit distance (identity for multiplication).
- Distributivity: The distribution property holds, meaning you can multiply and then add or add and then multiply planets' properties.

### Field

a set with two operations (addition and multiplication) where all nonzero elements form a group under multiplication, and both operations satisfy various properties like closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

In our planetary system, consider the population of planets excluding the one with zero moons (identity for addition).  
This subset forms a field under both addition (adding the distances between planets) and multiplication (multiplying the number of moons on planets).

- _Closure, Associativity, Identity, and Inverses_  
  The set of nonzero planets satisfy all these properties under both addition and multiplication.  
  For instance, you can add or multiply the properties of these planets, and the results are still within the set, and you can always find inverses.

### Generators

In abstract algebra, a generator is an element within a group that, when repeatedly combined with itself (through the group's operation), can generate all the elements of the group.

Imagine you have a powerful spaceship on your planet.  
This spaceship can travel from one planet to another and collect information about the number of moons and the distances between planets.  
You want to explore your planetary system using this spaceship.

- Generator: The spaceship represents a generator in our planetary system.  
  It has the ability to navigate through space and gather information about the properties of planets (moons and distances).

- Generating All Planets: The generator spaceship can start from one planet, collect data, then move to another planet, collect data again, and so on.  
  By repeating this process, it can eventually gather data about all the planets in the system.  
  In this way, the generator spaceship can generate information about all the elements (planets) in the system.

- Use of the Group Operation: The process of collecting information about each planet corresponds to applying the group operation (e.g., addition or multiplication) to the generator's current state and the properties of the planet it visits.  
  This operation allows the generator to move from one state (planet) to another while keeping track of all the planets it has visited.

# Find all the subgroups of the multiplicative group of $Z_{29}^\star$

$Z_{29}^\star$ is the multiplicative group of integers modulo 29,  
It consists of the integers between 1 and 28 that do not share any common factors with 29 other than 1.

And we already know that subgroups are subsets of a group that are themselves groups with respect to the same group operation.  
And here, the group operation is multiplication modulo 29.

- Trivial Subgroup:  
  The subgroup containing only the identity element (1) is always a subgroup of any group.  
  So, the trivial subgroup is {1}

- Cyclic Subgroups:  
  In $Z_{29}^\star$, we have cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the group.  
  a. Start with 2: Calculate powers of 2 modulo 29:-  
  2^1 mod 29 = 2
  2^2 mod 29 = 4
  .  
  .  
  .  
  2^24 mod 29 = 30 equivalent to 1 modulo 29  
  subgroup generated by 2 : {1,2,4,8,16,3,6,12,24,19,9,18,7,14,28,27,25,21,13,26,23,11,22,15}.  
  similarly we can try with other generators

- Subgroup of Order 2:  
  The subgroup containing only the identity element and one other element of order 2 (an element that squares to the identity) is also a subgroup.  
  For example, you can have a subgroup {1,28}

- Subgroup of Order 4:  
  Similarly we have subgroups of order 4, containing the identity element and three other elements.  
  For example, {1,4,16,7}.

- Subgroup of Order 7: You can also have subgroups of order 7, containing the identity element and six other elements.

Subgroup of Order 28: Finally, the entire group $Z_{29}^\star$ itself is also a subgroup.
